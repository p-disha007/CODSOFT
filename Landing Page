Number of Members: As per the Companies Act, 2013, the minimum number of members required to start a public limited company is seven while for a private limited company, it is two.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The founder is an integral part of the brand’s origin story, so making her the star of the page works. Think about including additional elements, like Bossy has, that can strengthen your About Us page, such as:

Brand-related Instagram posts
A welcome YouTube video
Links to partner charities and brands
Pictures of customers using your product
Interactive timelines that show company milestones
When you craft your About page, don’t forgo creativity for the sake of being professional, especially if that isn’t a value your brand stands for. What matters is that your brand is relatable to its target audience and meets them where they’re at.</p>
